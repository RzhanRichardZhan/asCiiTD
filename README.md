Once upon a time, a villager named Deedub lived in a village known as Ahksee.  Deedub was not the strongest swordsman, nor the steadiest bowman; but all the villagers knew that Deedub was the cleverest villager they had.  So when an evil wizard sent his forces to destroy the village, the villagers turned to Deedub to lead them...  
##It's a tower defense game.  
Place towers by entering coordinates.  The towers will shoot "arrows" at enemies.  Kill enemies to win.  Woo!
